python library for nutritional information 

Support for the first backend using the CC-BY 4.0-licensed [livsmidelsdatabasen](https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/om-oss/psidata/livsmedelsdatabasen) is ongoing, but not finished, so this library in a very early alpha stadium is of no practical use at the moment.
